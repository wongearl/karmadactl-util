                                to pass an arbitrary string to the webhook, for example, a
                                cluster identifier. \n Attempting to use a user or basic auth

                                from the \"host\" part of the URI as defined in RFC 3986:
                                1. IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can
                                only apply to the IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress. 2.
                                The `:` delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed.
                                Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http
                                and :443 for https. Both these may change in the future. Incoming
                                requests are matched against the host before the IngressRuleValue.
                                If the host is unspecified, the Ingress routes all traffic
                                based on the specified IngressRuleValue. \n Host can be \"precise\"
                                which is a domain name without the terminating dot of a network
                                host (e.g. \"foo.bar.com\") or \"wildcard\", which is a domain
                                name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. \"*.foo.com\").
                                The wildcard character '*' must appear by itself as the first
                                DNS label and matches only a single label. You cannot have
                                a wildcard label by itself (e.g. Host == \"*\"). Requests
                                will be matched against the Host field in the following way:
                                1. If Host is precise, the request matches this rule if the
                                http host header is equal to Host. 2. If Host is a wildcard,
                                then the request matches this rule if the http host header
                                is to equal to the suffix (removing the first label) of the
                                wildcard rule."

                              would be scheduled to primary clusters firstly, and when primary
                              cluster fails(like data center power off), Karmada scheduler
                              could migrate workloads to the backup clusters."

                              \n The scheduler will evaluate these groups one by one in the
                              order they appear in the spec, the group that does not satisfy
                              scheduling restrictions will be ignored which means all clusters
                              in this group will not be selected unless it also belongs to
                              the next group(a cluster could belong to multiple groups). \n

                              any cluster can be scheduling candidates. \n Potential use case
                              1: The private clusters in the local data center could be the
                              main group, and the managed clusters provided by cluster providers
                              could be the secondary group. So that the Karmada scheduler
                              would prefer to schedule workloads to the main group and the
                              second group will only be considered in case of the main group
                              does not satisfy restrictions(like, lack of resources). \n Potential
                              use case 2: For the disaster recovery scenario, the clusters
                              could be organized to primary and backup groups, the workloads
                              would be scheduled to primary clusters firstly, and when primary
                              cluster fails(like data center power off), Karmada scheduler
                              could migrate workloads to the backup clusters."

                          re-scheduler and probably select a substitute cluster to take over
                          the evicting workload(resource). 3. The graceful eviction controller
                          takes care of the graceful eviction tasks and performs the final
                          removal after the workload(resource) is available on the substitute
                          cluster or exceed the grace termination period(defaults to 10 minutes).'

                              second group will only be considered in case of the main group
                              does not satisfy restrictions(like, lack of resources). \n Potential

                              \n The scheduler will evaluate these groups one by one in the
                              order they appear in the spec, the group that does not satisfy
                              scheduling restrictions will be ignored which means all clusters
                              in this group will not be selected unless it also belongs to
                              the next group(a cluster could belong to multiple groups). \n
                              If none of the groups satisfy the scheduling restrictions, then
                              scheduling fails, which means no cluster will be selected. \n

                              any cluster can be scheduling candidates. \n Potential use case
                              1: The private clusters in the local data center could be the
                              main group, and the managed clusters provided by cluster providers
                              could be the secondary group. So that the Karmada scheduler
                              would prefer to schedule workloads to the main group and the
                              second group will only be considered in case of the main group
                              does not satisfy restrictions(like, lack of resources). \n Potential
                              use case 2: For the disaster recovery scenario, the clusters
                              could be organized to primary and backup groups, the workloads
                              would be scheduled to primary clusters firstly, and when primary
                              cluster fails(like data center power off), Karmada scheduler
                              could migrate workloads to the backup clusters."

                                to pass an arbitrary string to the webhook, for example, a
                                cluster identifier. \n Attempting to use a user or basic auth

                                from the \"host\" part of the URI as defined in RFC 3986:
                                1. IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can
                                only apply to the IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress. 2.
                                The `:` delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed.
                                Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http
                                and :443 for https. Both these may change in the future. Incoming
                                requests are matched against the host before the IngressRuleValue.
                                If the host is unspecified, the Ingress routes all traffic
                                based on the specified IngressRuleValue. \n Host can be \"precise\"
                                which is a domain name without the terminating dot of a network
                                host (e.g. \"foo.bar.com\") or \"wildcard\", which is a domain
                                name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. \"*.foo.com\").
                                The wildcard character '*' must appear by itself as the first
                                DNS label and matches only a single label. You cannot have
                                a wildcard label by itself (e.g. Host == \"*\"). Requests
                                will be matched against the Host field in the following way:
                                1. If Host is precise, the request matches this rule if the
                                http host header is equal to Host. 2. If Host is a wildcard,
                                then the request matches this rule if the http host header
                                is to equal to the suffix (removing the first label) of the
                                wildcard rule."

                              would be scheduled to primary clusters firstly, and when primary
                              cluster fails(like data center power off), Karmada scheduler
                              could migrate workloads to the backup clusters."

                              \n The scheduler will evaluate these groups one by one in the
                              order they appear in the spec, the group that does not satisfy
                              scheduling restrictions will be ignored which means all clusters
                              in this group will not be selected unless it also belongs to
                              the next group(a cluster could belong to multiple groups). \n

                              any cluster can be scheduling candidates. \n Potential use case
                              1: The private clusters in the local data center could be the
                              main group, and the managed clusters provided by cluster providers
                              could be the secondary group. So that the Karmada scheduler
                              would prefer to schedule workloads to the main group and the
                              second group will only be considered in case of the main group
                              does not satisfy restrictions(like, lack of resources). \n Potential
                              use case 2: For the disaster recovery scenario, the clusters
                              could be organized to primary and backup groups, the workloads
                              would be scheduled to primary clusters firstly, and when primary
                              cluster fails(like data center power off), Karmada scheduler
                              could migrate workloads to the backup clusters."

                          re-scheduler and probably select a substitute cluster to take over
                          the evicting workload(resource). 3. The graceful eviction controller
                          takes care of the graceful eviction tasks and performs the final
                          removal after the workload(resource) is available on the substitute
                          cluster or exceed the grace termination period(defaults to 10 minutes).'

                              second group will only be considered in case of the main group
                              does not satisfy restrictions(like, lack of resources). \n Potential

                              \n The scheduler will evaluate these groups one by one in the
                              order they appear in the spec, the group that does not satisfy
                              scheduling restrictions will be ignored which means all clusters
                              in this group will not be selected unless it also belongs to
                              the next group(a cluster could belong to multiple groups). \n
                              If none of the groups satisfy the scheduling restrictions, then
                              scheduling fails, which means no cluster will be selected. \n

                              any cluster can be scheduling candidates. \n Potential use case
                              1: The private clusters in the local data center could be the
                              main group, and the managed clusters provided by cluster providers
                              could be the secondary group. So that the Karmada scheduler
                              would prefer to schedule workloads to the main group and the
                              second group will only be considered in case of the main group
                              does not satisfy restrictions(like, lack of resources). \n Potential
                              use case 2: For the disaster recovery scenario, the clusters
                              could be organized to primary and backup groups, the workloads
                              would be scheduled to primary clusters firstly, and when primary
                              cluster fails(like data center power off), Karmada scheduler
                              could migrate workloads to the backup clusters."
